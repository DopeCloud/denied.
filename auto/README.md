The `ban.sh` will ban each ip wroted in `.txt` files.

the `ban.sh` should be executed 2 times one for `subnet` once for `single` ips.

the `ban.sh` reads each line one by one in `.txt` and bans them don't add invalid line like `# provider` or `#!/bin/bash` in `.txt` files because `ban.sh` will try to ban that!
